# Machine learning

There are a wide variety of [online courses](/courses)

## Mathematical notation

Understanding mathematical notation is essential to understanding machine learning. It provides a precise and compact language for expressing complex concepts, models, and algorithms. Key ideas such as gradient descent, loss functions, matrix operations, and probability distributions are most clearly and rigorously described in mathematical notation. 

However, I am acutely aware of the widespread allergy to mathematical notation, so I have attempted to supplement mathematical notation wherever possible with human-readable explanations of each relevant term.

<div className="flex align-middle justify-center text-3xl">
$$ \frac{\partial L}{\partial W^{[l]}}$$ 
$$=$$ $$\delta^{[l]}$$
$$\cdot$$
$$(A^{[l-1]})^T$$
</div>

If mathematical notation is a foreign language to you, but you have the motivation to learn it, you can do so in the same way as you would learn any other language - by immersion. Without mathematical notation, you will also be unable to read research papers or effectively reason about machine learning algorithms.
