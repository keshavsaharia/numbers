# Real Rationals

- Compare iOS calculator to Android calculator.

The purpose of a calculator app is to give correct answers. [Floating point numbers](/learn/floats/) are inherently imprecise, so a calculator that relies entirely on floating point arithmetic is like a house built on sand.

## Representing numbers

- Most numbers cannot be precisely represented by floating point values, and must be rounded.
- Simple operations like summation of floating point values requires careful algorithms to handle error

## Big numbers

- JavaScript `BigInt` solves this problem for integers
- Represent a fraction as two `BigInt` values
- How about representing pi or sqrt(2)?

## Algebraic numbers

- Represent numbers by polynomial, so sqrt(2) is x^2 - 2 = 0
- Math operations are a bit trickier (add polynomials)
- Multiply with polynomial composition and resultants
- Still only works for algebraic numbers, does not get us pi

Create a diagram here:
- Image of hierarchy (natural (N) - integer (Z) - rational (Q) - real algebraic (A_R) - real (R) )
- Highlight irrational (real algebraic + real) and transcendental (Real)
- Real examples: e, pi, -2pi, cos(theta)

Constructive real numbers are numbers which can be computed to an arbitrary degree of accuracy.

You can't give me every single digit of $$\pi$$, but you can define a function $$\pi(\delta)$$ which gives me the value of $$\pi$$ that is within $$\delta$$ of the true value.

```javascript
// Leibniz formula: pi/4 = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7
function pi(tolerance) {
    let sum = 0;
    let i = 0;
    let term = 1;

    while (Math.abs(term) > tolerance) {
        term = 1 / (2 * i + 1);
        sum = i % 2 == 0 ? (sum + term) : (sum - term);
        i++;
    }

    return sum * 4;
}
```
