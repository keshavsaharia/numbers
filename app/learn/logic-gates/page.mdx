# Logic gates

Logic gates are the building blocks of digital circuits. They are used to perform logical operations on binary data.

# NOT gates

A **not gate** takes a single input and returns the opposite value.

<BooleanGate type="not" />

# AND gates

An **and gate** is a gate that takes two inputs and returns true if both inputs are true.

<BooleanGate type="and" />

A **nand gate** returns the opposite result of an and gate.

<BooleanGate type="nand" />

## OR gates

An **or gate** returns true if at least one input is true.

<BooleanGate type="or" />

A **nor gate** returns the opposite result of an or gate.

<BooleanGate type="nor" />

## XOR gates

A **xor gate** returns true if one input is true and the other is false.

<BooleanGate type="xor" />

A **xnor gate** returns true if both inputs are the same.

<BooleanGate type="xnor" />
