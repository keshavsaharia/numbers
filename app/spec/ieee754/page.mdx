## IEEE754

In the [IEEE 754 standard](/spec/ieee754) for floating-point arithmetic, a real number is approximated using a format like:

$$ x = (-1)^s \cdot m \cdot 2^e$$

Where:
- $$ s $$: Sign bit
- $$ m $$: Mantissa or significand (typically normalized)
- $$ e $$: Exponent

Because only a finite number of bits are used to store $$ m $$ and $$ e $$, not every real number can be exactly represented â€” hence the need to analyze errors introduced in representation and computation.
