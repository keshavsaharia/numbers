# ClickHouse

ClickHouse is a high-performance column-oriented database management system designed for real-time analytics on large volumes of data. While its speed and efficiency have made it popular in production environments, its internal architecture is a masterclass in systems design. 

This is a deep dive into the internals of ClickHouse, which attempts to trace an optimal learner's path through the source code to uncover how its core components work. We'll explore the data structures, algorithms, and design principles that make it one of the fastest OLAP databases in the world, and a brilliant contribution to the open-source ecosystem. Whether you're a systems engineer, database developer, or open-source contributor, this will hopefully equip you with a detailed understanding of how ClickHouse operates from the inside out.
