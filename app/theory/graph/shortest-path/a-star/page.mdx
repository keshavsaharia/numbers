# A* algorithm

The A* algorithm is a is a variant of [Dijkstra's algorithm](/theory/graph/shortest-path/dijkstra) that uses a **heuristic function** to estimate the cost of the shortest path. The heuristic function is a function that estimates the cost of the shortest path from the current node to the goal node.
