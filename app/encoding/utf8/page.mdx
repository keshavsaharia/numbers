# UTF-8

UTF-8, or **8-bit Unicode Transformation Format**, is the dominant character encoding used on the web and in modern software systems. UTF-8 encodes [Unicode](#unicode) characters into sequences of bytes, while preserving backward compatibility with [ASCII](/encoding/ascii). The efficiency and versatility of UTF-8 have made it the default encoding standard for text in most applications.

## Unicode

Unicode is a character set (not an encoding) which assigns a code point to every character in every language - U+0041 for "A", U+03B1 for Greek alpha (Î±), U+1F600 for ðŸ˜€. Unicode can address over 1.1 million characters, from U+0000 to U+10FFFF.

UTF-8 is an encoding format defined by Unicode, where each character is encoded using 1 to 4 bytes. In this way, UTF-8 is a **variable length encoding**, where 

 But we still need a way to serialize or encode those code points into bytes to store in files or transmit over networks. That's where UTF-8 comes in.
