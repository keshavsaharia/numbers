# ASCII

The **American Standard Code for Information Interchange** was developed in the 1960s. It uses 7 bits to represent 128 characters, including English letters, digits, and basic symbols.

- ASCII doesn't support other languages, emojis, or special symbols.
- To handle global languages and symbols, Unicode was developed.
