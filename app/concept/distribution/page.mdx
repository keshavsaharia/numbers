# Distribution of numbers

The numbers that can be represented in floating point format are exponentially distributed. This is why floating point arithmetic is generally well-behaved (i.e. maintains a low relative error) when you multiply things. Addition in floating point works best when you add similar numbers. Overflow is almost impossible, but it's easy to get loss of significance.

The numbers that you can represent with fixed point are uniformly distributed. Fixed point is well-behaved when you add things, and it maintains a good absolute error. Loss of significance doesn't happen, but it's easy to get an overflow. 

In both systems it's possible to accumulate error, but under normal circumstances the approximation error should average out. Fixed point makes it easier to reason about the error, floating point is a bit harder, but usually works well in practice.
