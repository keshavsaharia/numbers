## Backward Error and Stability

In **numerical analysis**, we often care about how much the input needs to be perturbed to account for the observed [relative error](/concept/relative-error) in the output. This leads to the notion of **backward error** and **algorithmic stability**.

An algorithm is said to be **backward stable** if it gives the exact result for a nearby input. This often implies a small relative error in well-conditioned problems.
