# Units in last place

The measurement **ulp** stands for **U**nit in the **L**ast **P**lace, and is a common measurement of mathematical accuracy. [Kahan](/people/kahan)'s original definition of *ulp* in the 1960s was

> $$\text{ulp}(x)$$ is the gap between the two floating-point numbers nearest $$x$$, even if $$x$$ is one of them.

That is, if you take the binary representation of a floating point number and increment it, the difference is 1 ulp.

"Ulp"  was coined to characterize the accuracies of implementations of run-time math library functions on the  IBM 7090 and 7094, which were not as accurate nor fast as they should have been in 1960. By 1964 most of their deficiencies had been repaired by contributions to SHARE (the organized users of  IBM  mainframes), and especially by the work of Hirondo Kuki at the  University of Chicago.

> From time to time, well-intentioned attempts to speed up a math library introduced inaccuries so large that Fred Gustavson  at IBM Yorktown Heights  coined the word  "GULP"  (Giga-Ulp)  to describe them.  Today, there is no excuse for a math library less accurate than the  Freely Distributed Math Library `fdlibm`, promulgated from  Sun Microsystems mostly by graduates from the  University of California at Berkeley, who created the libraries distributed with 4.3 BSD Berkeley UNIX in the  1980s.

By then the adoption of [IEEE Standard 754](/spec/ieee754) had made infinities and NaNs so ubiquitous that the definition of an ulp had to be changed:

> $$\text{ulp}(x)$$ is the gap between the two *finite* floating-point numbers nearest $$x$$, even if $$x$$ is one of them, and $$\text{ulp}(NaN)$$  is  $$NaN$$.

E.g.,  for  IEEE 754 Double Precision  (8 bytes wide)  as in  MATLAB,
ulp(1) = eps/2,  ulp(1.5) = eps,  ulp(inf) = 2^971,  ulp(0) = 2^-1074 .

                            Why  "_finite_" ?

Without this word we would have  ulp(Infinity) = Infinity ,  which is
not too bad but not so good in situations like the following:

For every finite floating-point number  y  we expect computed values
    x := ( y - ulp(y) rounded )    and   z := ( y + ulp(y) rounded )
to satisfy  $$x <= y <= z$$.  We cannot expect  $$x < y < z$$  in every
case;  consider the case  y := 1  and remember that by default  IEEE
754  rounds midway cases to nearest even so  z = 1 .  These inferences
hold for decimal floating-point too though for very different reasons.
By defining  ulp(Infinity)  to be finite we sustain these inferences at
infinite  y  too;  they would be invalidated there otherwise.  Tighter
inferences are available just when  y  is finite;  then

$$ x < y <= z ,   or   x <= y < z , $$  or both

Both strict inequalities are false if  y  is infinite;  even so,  no
INVALID OPERATON  occurs.  Were  ulp(Infinity) = Infinity ,  an INVALID
OPERATION  would occur at  x := y - ulp(y)  producing  NaN,  and again
at each comparison of  x  and  y .  Gratuitous  INVALID OPERATIONs
like these seem to punish a program cruelly and unusually:  they would
wrest control from it in many environmemts,  though not  MATLAB's.

Here is a vectorized MATLAB program to compute `ulp(x)` on machines whose arithmetics conform to [IEEE Standard 754](/spec/ieee754), as almost all do now.

```matlab
function  u = ulp(x)
%  ulp(x)  is the gap between the two finite floating-point numbers
%  nearest  x ,  even if  x  is one of them.  ulp(NaN)  is  NaN .  E.g.,
%  ulp(1) = eps/2,  ulp(1.5) = eps,  ulp(inf) = 2^971,  ulp(0) = 2^-1074

u = abs(real(x)) ;                  %... to propagate  NaN
k = ( u < 5.0e-308 ) ;              %... copes with  x  too near  0
if any(k(:)),  v = k*5.0e-324 ;  u(k) = v(k) ;  end
j = ( 9.0e307 < u ) ;               %... copes with  x  near  Infinity
if any(j(:)),  v = j*(2^(1024-53)) ;  u(j) = v(j) ;  end
j = ~(j|k) ;                        %... copes with the rest
if any(j(:))
    v = u(j) ;  w = (0.7*eps)*v ;   %... "0.7"  works for  IEEE 754
    u(j) = min( (v+w)-v, (w-v)+v ) ;  end
if any(imag(x(:))),  u = u + i*ulp(imag(x)) ;  end % recursive call !
