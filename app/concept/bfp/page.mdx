# Block Floating Point (BFP)


The BFP representation groups numerical values that share a common exponent, allowing for efficient scaling and quantization. This makes BFP representations particularly effective for AI applications that can tolerate reduced precision without significant loss in accuracy.

The adoption of MX formats is supported by major industry players, including AMD, Arm, Intel, Meta, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Qualcomm, reflecting a collective effort to standardize low-precision data formats for AI workloads. By implementing these formats, organizations can achieve improved performance and energy efficiency in AI training and inference tasks.
