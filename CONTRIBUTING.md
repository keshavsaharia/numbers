# Contributing to Number Representations & States

Thanks for your interest in improving this open-source guide! Whether you're fixing a typo, suggesting a new topic, or helping clarify an explanation, your contribution is appreciated. Changes to the `dev` branch will automatically trigger `next build` and update [https://dev.number.rest](https://dev.number.rest), and pull requests to the `master` branch is how the live site [https://number.rest](https://number.rest) gets updated.

## üõ† How to Contribute

- **Fix typos, grammar, or clarity issues** - outside of the [learning resources](https://number.rest/learn), there should be a consistent and professional tone.
- **Suggest edits to existing explanations** - you can [open an issue](https://github.com/keshavsaharia/number-rest/issues) to suggest updates and changes
- **Add practical code examples that illustrate key concepts** - these would be greatly appreciated, please ensure that everything is free to share
- **Improve accessibility, navigation, or readability** - calling all React developers!
- **Report bugs or broken links** - extremely helpful for a one-man operation

Please keep contributions beginner-friendly, with a focus on clarity and approachability. When in doubt, write as if explaining to someone learning the topic for the first time, and link to the existing concept cards as much as possible.

## ‚úÖ Contribution Guidelines

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch.
2. Make your changes.
3. Open a pull request with a clear explanation of your edits.
4. Follow the existing tone and style where possible.
5. Be respectful in discussions ‚Äî we‚Äôre here to learn and teach together!

## ‚ùå Out of Scope

To keep the guide focused and approachable, please avoid the following:

- **Advanced high-precision math libraries** (e.g., GMP, MPFR)
- **Hardware-level design or electrical engineering** topics
- **Scientific computing methods or numerical PDEs**
- **Formal verification or mathematical proofs**
- **Obscure or legacy character encodings**
- **Highly architecture-specific behaviors or undocumented CPU quirks**
- **Deep dives into base conversion algorithms**

These are all fascinating topics but are better served in specialized resources. Our focus is on practical, essential knowledge for everyday developers.
